# THE-SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
A smart, automated irrigation system designed to optimize water usage and improve agricultural productivity by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This system senses real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data to automate irrigation decisions and reduce water wastage.
## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build a sensor-based smart irrigation system that conserves water and increases crop yield by automating the irrigation process based on real-time field conditions.
